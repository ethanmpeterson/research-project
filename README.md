# Research Project

This repository contains several python files that contain physics simulations for my research project. Below is a description of each simulation.

## Universal Controls

- Press space to pause
- Press p to play
- Press r to restart
- Press esc to exit the simulation

## Basic Freefall

- Filename: freefall_basic.py

The basic freefall simulation is the simplest of the three. The simulation assumes perfect vaccum conditions where there is no air resistance and the object is subjected to gravitational acceleration. The simulation has customizable starting values such gravitational acceleration, initial velocity, initial position and ground position. These values can all be changed at the top of the file by changing the value of the concerned variable.
